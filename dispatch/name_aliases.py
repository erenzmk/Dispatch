"""Utilities for resolving technician name aliases.

This module contains a small helper :func:`canonical_name` that is used
throughout the project to normalise technician names.  In the real world the
source data is far from consistent â€“ sometimes we only receive the first name,
other times the full name in ``"Lastname, Firstname (Extra)"`` form.  The
previous implementation performed a simple case-insensitive fuzzy match which
meant that entries like ``"Ahmad, Daniyal (Keskin)"`` were not matched to the
existing ``"Daniyal"`` entry in ``Liste.xlsx``.  As a consequence new rows were
added for these verbose names and the daily numbers ended up in the wrong
place.

To make the matching more robust we now strip auxiliary information like
parentheses and leading surnames before performing the fuzzy comparison.  This
mirrors how dispatchers refer to colleagues in the spreadsheet and keeps the
output tidy.
